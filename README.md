Project for Mobile Application Development: Android.
HOGENT Campus Aalst

AstroByte is a simple space-exploration related news app.
Fetch the latest articles and press the arrow button to get redirected to the online news article, or press on the star icon to save an article for offline reading.
Whenever you want to read an offline article, just navigate to the Saved articles page and click on the arrow. When you're done reading, feel free to press the star icon again to delete the article from your device.
Feel free to use in both portrait and landscape mode on your device, with or without access to the Internet.

#### **Note:** using a Resizable (Experimental) emulator may cause the emulator to crash upon opening a news article on Google Chrome, this is not this app's fault as the emulator could crash upon opening Chrome without this app's interference. Opt for a device emulator instead if you desire to test the online reading feature.
